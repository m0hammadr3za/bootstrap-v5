# Bootstrap v5 template

Live demo at: [bootstrap-v5.vercel.app](https://bootstrap-v5.vercel.app)

This was a project required by cs50 problem set 8, but i decided to dive in a little more and make a bootstrap v5 project.

There are four pages in this template:

    - Home
    - Contact
    - gallery
    - Upcomming

For homepage I tried to make something that represents a normal blog's homepage. the navbar has some custom js on it for the scrolling effect.

In contact page the contact form is interactive and if you submit your form a bootstrap modal will be shown with your email address and message.

For gallery page you can click on each image to see the full size image. i could have used thumbnail images, but since my main focus was bootstrap and preview feature with custom js, I didn't really bother with that.

Upcomming page is the most custom page. it has a timer that counts down the hours, minutes and seconds remaning until next year. also with custom animations for the countdown.
